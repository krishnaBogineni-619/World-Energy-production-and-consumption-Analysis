# World-Energy-production-and-consumption-Analysis

In this project, we apply data analysis techniques and interactive visualizations to unravel the historical shifts in energy production and consumption patterns.
The project explores the interplay between various energy resources and identifies key factors that have shaped the energy landscape over the years. Additionally,
we investigate the implications of these trends on sustainability and the environment.

The interactive data visualizations offer an intuitive platform for users to explore and interpret the complex relationships between energy production, consumption, and trade on a
global scale.
